This an application I wrote using Java when I was working for a small Japanese Internet
company. It syncronizes db tables and data (excludes index, jobs and other
staff) with SQL Server 2005 and PostgreSQL 8.3. Actually, it's single direction,
from SQL server to PostgreSQL.

Check it out if you are interested.

You can see I uploaded the eclipse classpath configuration file which I think
might be helpful when you run into jar missing errors.
