## Introduction
This an application I wrote using Java when I was working for a small Japanese
Internet
company. It syncronizes db tables and data (**excludes** index, jobs and other
staff) with SQL Server 2005 and PostgreSQL 8.3. Actually, it's single direction,
from SQL server to PostgreSQL.

## Usage
Just import this project into Eclipse and add the missing jar files. Sorry to
say I didn't 
upload the jar files since they are space cost, but you can see I uploaded the
eclipse 
classpath and project configuration file which I think might be helpful when you 
run into jar missing errors. Check it out if you are interested.
